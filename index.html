<h1>What if webinars were as engaging as real-life seminars?</h1>

<p>Webinars are great, in a lot of ways. In others, they sort of suck.</p>

<p>Here's 4 ways <strong>today's webinars let attenders down.</strong></p>

<h2>1. You can't (really) interact with each other.</h2>
<p>Ever been to a real life seminar?</p>
<p>You meet people there. <em>You make friendships.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes friendships that lead to joint ventures or partnerships or other business benefits.</p>
<p>So why do webinars reduce you to "1 of 403"? <em>Why can't you talk to the other 402?</em></p>
<p><strong>What if there was a way you could interact with these people, as if it was real life?</strong></p>

<h2>2. There's software to faff about with.</h2>
<p>What happens when the webinar starts?</p>
<p>You have to install another plugin.</p>
<p>Or you never had the plugin to begin with…</p>
<p>Or with so many buttons you can't tell where to type questions…</p>
<p>Or the PowerPoint presentation isn't working right…</p>
<p><em>OK, so the last one happens in real life too.</em></p>
<p>But the rest all fall under the category of <em>"tech stuff"</em> that you'd never think about in real life.</p>
<p><strong>You'd have all your energy on socializing, or engaging with the seminar</strong>, or thinking about the value.</p>
<p>What if webinars were like that?</p>

<h2>3. It's basically just <em>watching</em>, not <em>engaging</em>.</h2>
<p>What's the difference between a webinar and a video?</p>
<p>We should be able to say the webinar is social, engaging, memorable, <strong>special…</strong></p>
<p>We can't though. <em>Because 99% of the time, they're not.</em></p>
<p>They're normally just videos you can't pause, skip or rewatch.</p>

<h2>The bottom line.</h2>
<p><em>Webinars are missing huge opportunities to create engagement, relationships and lasting change.</em></p>
<p>But there's a small number of people who (like you) are now privvy to this gaping opportunity.</p>
<p>An opportunity to use a <strong>new tool that will address all these problems.</strong></p>
<p>That will let you stand out from the crowd instantly, and get massively better results.</p>
<p>A tool which they'll have access to, <strong>for free, forever.</strong></p>
<p><em>Even when others are paying hundreds of dollars to use it.</em></p>

<h2>Here's What To Do Next.</h2>
<p><a href="/yes/">I've created a form</a> to collect the names and emails of people who want free forever access to this new tool.</p>
<p>Seriously, free forever. Subscription costs, all that stuff, waived, forever.</p>
<p>Assuming you're OK with that, <a href="/yes/">you'll want to fill it in.</a></p>

<h2>Why do that? What's the catch?</h2>
<p>There is one catch.</p>
<p>I want to get your feedback on this tool. I want you to play with it, share your thoughts, and help make it even better.</p>
<p><strong>That's it.</strong></p>
<p>In return, you'll never have to pay a penny. <em>Even if you have no current use it,</em> you'll still have forever-free access.</p>
<p>If this sounds good to you, go ahead and <a href="/yes/">fill out that form, before all availability is taken.</a></p>
<p><a href="/yes/" class="button">Fill out the form while there's availability</a></p>
